# File Explorer App - Simple Explanation 📁

Let me explain this file explorer app like you're learning it in 10th grade!

## 🎯 What is this app?
Think of **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** - that's exactly what we're building! It's a website where you can:
- Login with your Google or Microsoft account
- Upload files from your computer
- Create folders to organize files
- Download files back to your computer
- Delete files you don't need

## 🏗️ How is it built? (Like building a house)

Our app has **2 main parts**:

### 1. **Frontend (What you see)** 🎨
- Built with **React** (like HTML but smarter)
- This is the pretty interface you click on
- Has buttons, file lists, upload areas
- Runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. **Backend (The brain)** 🧠  
- Built with **Python FastAPI** (like a smart assistant)
- Handles all the work behind the scenes
- Stores your files safely
- Checks if you're allowed to access files
- Runs on `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔐 How does login work?

Instead of creating new usernames/passwords, we use **SSO (Single Sign-On)**:

```
You click "Login with Google" 
    ↓
Google asks: "Do you want to let this app access your info?"
    ↓
You click "Yes"
    ↓
Google gives our app a special "token" (like a temporary ID card)
    ↓
Our app creates your personal folder
    ↓
You're logged in! 🎉
```

## 📂 How does file management work?

### **Uploading a file:**
```
You drag a file to the upload area
    ↓
Frontend sends file to Backend
    ↓
Backend checks: "Is this user allowed? Is file safe?"
    ↓
Backend saves file in user's personal folder
    ↓
Backend tells Frontend: "File saved successfully!"
    ↓
You see the file appear in your list
```

### **Downloading a file:**
```
You click "Download" button
    ↓
Backend checks: "Does this file belong to this user?"
    ↓
Backend sends the file back
    ↓
Your browser downloads it to your Downloads folder
```

## 🛡️ Security (Keeping your files safe)

### **User Isolation:**
- Each user gets their own folder: `/uploads/john123/`
- You can NEVER see other people's files
- Like having separate lockers in school

### **Path Security:**
```python
# Bad hacker tries: "../../../other_users_files"
# Our code says: "NOPE! Stay in your own folder!"
```

### **File Validation:**
- Only allows safe file types (.jpg, .pdf, .txt, etc.)
- Maximum 10MB per file
- No dangerous executable files

## 🔄 Complete Flow Example

Let's say you want to upload a photo:

**Step 1: Login**
```
1. You open website
2. Click "Login with Google"
3. Google confirms it's really you
4. You're logged in!
```

**Step 2: Upload Photo**
```
1. You drag "vacation.jpg" to upload area
2. Frontend: "Hey Backend, here's a photo!"
3. Backend: "Let me check... User is valid ✓, File is safe ✓"
4. Backend saves photo in your folder: `/uploads/your-id/vacation.jpg`
5. Frontend: "Upload successful! Here's your file list"
```

**Step 3: View Files**
```
1. Backend: "Here are all files in your folder"
2. Frontend shows you a nice list with file names, sizes, dates
3. You see "vacation.jpg - 2.3 MB - Today"
```

## 🐳 Docker (Running the app)

Think of Docker like **instant noodles**:
- Instead of buying ingredients and cooking (installing Python, Node.js, etc.)
- We have pre-made packages that just need hot water (Docker)
- One command runs everything!

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command:
1. Downloads all needed tools
2. Starts the Frontend server
3. Starts the Backend server  
4. Connects them together
5. Opens the website at `localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Technologies Used (Simple explanations)

### **Frontend:**
- **React**: Makes websites interactive (like when you click a button, something happens)
- **JavaScript**: The language that makes websites "do stuff"
- **HTML/CSS**: Makes websites look pretty

### **Backend:**
- **Python**: Easy programming language (like English for computers)
- **FastAPI**: Tool that helps Python talk to websites
- **JWT**: Digital ID cards that prove you're logged in

### **Others:**
- **Docker**: Runs the app on any computer the same way
- **OAuth**: Safe way to login with Google/Microsoft

## 📱 What the user sees:

1. **Login Page**: Big buttons saying "Login with Google" or "Login with Microsoft"
2. **Dashboard**: Your personal file manager with:
   - List of your files and folders
   - Upload area (drag & drop)
   - Download buttons
   - Delete buttons
   - "Create Folder" button

## ⚡ Why FastAPI (Python) vs Node.js?

**FastAPI Advantages:**
- **Faster**: Can handle many users at once better
- **Auto-docs**: Creates instruction manual automatically
- **Type Safety**: Catches errors before they happen
- **Easy to read**: Python is like English

Think of it like:
- **Node.js**: A good bicycle
- **FastAPI**: A motorcycle (faster, more features)

## 🚀 How to actually run this:

1. **Download all the code files** (copy-paste everything shown above)
2. **Get OAuth keys:**
   - Go to Google Developer Console
   - Create a project and get Client ID
   - Same for Microsoft
3. **Put keys in .env file**
4. **Run command:** `docker-compose up --build`
5. **Open browser:** `http://localhost:3000`
6. **Login and start uploading files!**

## 🎓 Key Learning Points:

1. **Frontend & Backend are separate** but talk to each other
2. **Security is super important** - never trust user input
3. **Modern apps use existing login systems** (Google, Microsoft) instead of making new ones
4. **Docker makes deployment easy** - works the same everywhere
5. **APIs are like waiters** - they take your order (request) and bring you food (response)

This is a complete, production-ready file management system that you could actually use in real life! The same concepts are used by companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix. 🚀
